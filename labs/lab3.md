# Lab 3: Theming with Jetpack Compose
In this lab, we'll explore home theming is done within Jetpack Compose.

- Open up your project's `Theme.kt` file and examine how the `MaterialTheme` function works
- Customize your app's color palette for both light and dark model
    - Change your device theme between light and dark model to observe your updated theme
- Customize the typography of your theme by opening `Type.kt` and configuring different `TextStyle` properties on the `Typography` object
    - If you haven't already, try applying those styles to the `Text` Composables in `MainScreen()`
- Change the default `Button` shape by modifying the `small` property of the `Shapes` object defined in `Shapes.kt`
